Fantasy Premier League â€“ Machine Learning Prediction Model

This project applies machine learning to predict Fantasy Premier League (FPL) player performance and guide weekly team selection across a full season.
The aim is to combine data analysis, predictive modelling, and portfolio-style optimisation to create a smarter and more consistent FPL strategy.

Key Features:

-Data wrangling and cleaning from FPL and other relevant sources

-Feature engineering using player stats, fixtures, and team context

-ML models to estimate expected points for each player

-Season-long optimisation for simulated team decision-making

-SQL integration for structured data management

-Python-based, modular code structure

Project Structure Overview:

-notebooks/: Exploratory work and model development in Jupyter

-src/: Python modules for preprocessing, modelling, and utilities

-data/: Raw and processed datasets (excluded from GitHub)

-.gitignore, requirements.txt, and README for setup and documentation

How to Use:
Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt. Note that the full dataset is not included in the repo due to size. Sample data or instructions for fetching the data may be added later.
If you want the full raw and processed data, beyond the fpl.db, then message me and I can give you the data.

Future Improvements:

-Tighter model tuning and evaluation

-Feature selection improvements

-Strategy visualisation and performance tracking

-Optimisation strategies for full season

-Deep Learning through PyTorch or TensorFlow
